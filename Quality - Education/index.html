    <p>
        SDG 17 is essential because no single country or organization can solve global issues alone. 
        Challenges such as poverty, climate change, education gaps, and inequality require cooperation 
        at local, national, and international levels. Through strong partnerships, nations can combine 
        resources, ideas, and expertise to create sustainable and long-lasting solutions.
